Here lies the assembly source code to build a valid 76 byte amd64 ELF executable
that writes out the word "scarf\n" and cleanly exits.

This ELF file also exists in a physical form as a scarf.

Use `make` to build the binary, which you can then run as
`./tinyelfscarf` `nasm`, the Netwide Assembler, must be installed
